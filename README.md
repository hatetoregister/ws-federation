ws-federation
=============

A generic (but complete) example of WS-Federation as implemented in .NET

---

There is more information about the [specifications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WS-Federation) and their [.NET "flavor"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Identity_Foundation) than I 
would feel comfortable trying to aggregate here. The bulk of this implementation will be based on the [development guide for WIF for .NET 4.5 found on CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/504399/Understanding-Windows-Identity-Foundation-WIF-4-5).
